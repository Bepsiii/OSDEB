Open Source Discord Entertainment Bot

This is a largely open source AI generated project i have created as a basic discord bot. some of the features include:
Gemini API access + commands - Gemini API is FREE for personal use. i am not responsible for using the API for commercial use
incredibly basic economy system using JSON
Largly a music bot that supports Soundcloud and any other services that dont require API Access to play from them. the bot also has the ability to use local files in the Music Folder
This is also a largely modular bot with cogs and commands being stored in separate files from the main python file.
Best command is being able to fish someone which takes a image from the fish folder and messages the target with a random image of a fish. cause why not?

For what its worth, its definitely not anything amazing but its good enough for basic useâ„¢ 
Dont be a penis with the code and everything will be fine and work.
